--- Before Running


-- python manage.py makemigrations gcn
--	python manage.py migrate
--	python manage.py runserver


-> Our project currently runs without population script,
-> For full functionality please run populate_gcn.py to load in
-> Clubs/Nights etc



--- Log In Hierarchy 

-> (if you create a superUser) 

-> ideally we tried to use populate script to load in the club
-> names with permissions regarding adding pages etc. However was unable to do such functionality
-> instead, if you create superUser = 'kushion' , we have completed functionality where this works 
-> for adding a page and navbar changes depending.
-> Creating a user (any name/password) will allow you to leave a review



--- Kushion Currently is our most complete Page
    If you chose to leave a review during testing, please do so for kushion on admin, our form is currently under construction
    as code comments. 
    These will then be dispalyed on Kushion web page as it should do after you do so.


aside : Given more time we would replicate Kushion page to each individual club with reviews
	changing depending on username ie 'kushion' or 'bamboo' 

enjoy (our easter eggs especially)
